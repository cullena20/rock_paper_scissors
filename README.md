# rock_paper_scissors
A rock paper scissors game in Python made with JetBrains Academy.

## Rules
The user is able to enter their own list of options. The names of these options are arbitrary. Viewing the list of options
as circular, each option will beat half of the list before it and lose to half of the list after it. This only works with
an odd number of options.

## File
After exiting the program, the user's name and score is added to a file list. If a user inputs the same name as one on the file,
they will start with the score retrieved from the file.
