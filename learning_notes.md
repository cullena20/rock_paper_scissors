# Learning Notes
So I'm going to write some learning notes with every project I do now. I think it would be nice to reflect and maybe have something to
look back at in the future. With every project I do, I learn to think more like a computer scientist, become a better problem
solver, and of course learn syntax. I'll write down any big reflections I have after every project. So without further ado.

# Actual Reflection
This is the third largish Python project I worked on (after making the coffee machine with jetbrains and the hangman game by myself). 
I learned to work with files in Python with this project. I worked with lists and got better at solving problems with them. I got 
additional practice applying ideas that I have learned. I experienced a lot of frusturation figuring out the logic with the list.
Anyone is going to experience this, but it's important to reflect and not get frusturated in a way that helps no one. 

# Git Stuff
I mostly get the idea of the git workflow but I'm still confused about how to work with it. Obviously copying and pasting things into github
is not a productive workflow. I'll leave it with this project since I want to get in the habit of publishing to github but also don't
want to bother too much posting this huge unavigatable project. I will get better with this.
